## Background

Investors and financial analysts often rely on accurate stock price predictions to make informed decisions regarding buying, holding, or selling stocks. Traditional forecasting methods sometimes fall short in capturing complex market patterns and volatility. With advancements in machine learning, it is now possible to leverage sophisticated algorithms to improve the accuracy of stock price predictions.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust application that accurately forecasts stock prices using historical data and multiple machine learning algorithms. The application should also provide clear visualizations and actionable recommendations based on forecasted trends.

## Key Challenges

- **Data Acquisition:** Ensuring reliable and timely fetching of historical stock data.
- **Data Processing:** Handling different intervals (minute-level and daily) and ensuring data consistency.
- **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning models that can effectively capture market trends and patterns.
- **Prediction Accuracy:** Minimizing prediction errors to enhance the reliability of forecasts.
- **User Interface:** Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for inputting stock symbols and date ranges, and for visualizing the results.
- **Recommendations:** Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on forecasted stock trends.

## Scope

### Historical Data Fetching

- Use the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data based on user inputs for stock symbol, start date, and end date.

### Data Visualization

- Implement interactive charts using `Plotly` to visualize historical and forecasted stock prices.

### Machine Learning Models

- Implement and compare the following models for stock price forecasting:
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - Linear Regression
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

### Error Metrics

- Calculate and display error metrics for each model to assess prediction accuracy.

### User Interface

- Develop a `Streamlit`-based user interface for easy interaction and data input.
- Display historical data, visualizations, additional stock metrics, and forecasting results.

### Recommendations

- Generate buy/hold/sell recommendations based on the forecasted trends.

## Expected Outcomes

- A functional application that fetches, processes, and visualizes stock data.
- Accurate stock price forecasts using ARIMA, Linear Regression, and LSTM models.
- Clear visualizations that help users understand historical trends and future predictions.
- Actionable recommendations to assist users in making informed investment decisions.
- Comparative analysis of different forecasting models based on their prediction accuracy.

## Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning models, this project aims to improve the accuracy of stock price forecasting, thereby providing valuable insights and recommendations to investors and financial analysts. The development of a user-friendly application will facilitate easy access to these advanced forecasting tools and help users make better investment decisions.
